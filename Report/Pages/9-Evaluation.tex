\section{Evaluation of results and project review}

\subsection{Project Review}
\subsection{What we learnt}
Using ANTLR to parse a Java program into associated tokens. 
How to detect plagiarisms using a well known algorithm 

I personally found it pleasant to work in this team and learnt about task deligation etc 

most things learnt are general and I think the same for all of us in terms of the actual project outcomes.
