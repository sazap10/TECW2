\section{Testing}
The aim of testing in this project is to gain an understanding of the chosen algorithm's effectiveness in identifying file similarity. This has been achieved through the writing of a simple testing script in Java a number of test file inputs.

The test script is written in Java and simply invokes the main method of our similarity testing main class. All possible pairs are tested together, including the reversal of pairs (although these will likely yield identical results), ie x,y and y,x combinations are tested.  

Test inputs have been created and categorised using the criteria of the different clone types. These are:
